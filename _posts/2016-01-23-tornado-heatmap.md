## Project description:
Using the Heatmap Layer in Google Maps API, I developed a visualization of Tornado intensity for each month of 2011 in the US. The visualization can be used to analyze areas that were hot spots for Tornado outbreaks and during which time of year they were prone to tornado occurrences.

## Technologies used:
* Google Maps API
* Heatmap Layer Library
