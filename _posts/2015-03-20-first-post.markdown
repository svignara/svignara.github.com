I am updating my github page to now include a blog. To check out the old page that I had with my side projects and my work experiences [click here][old-site].

Why am I changing things up all of a sudden? Well, I'm on vacation for the next 10 days (till March 30th 2015), and am not travelling this time around. So I decided I'll spend the next few days learning some cool stuff, and working on my new blog.

So stay tuned, I'm going to try and make things interesting here.
